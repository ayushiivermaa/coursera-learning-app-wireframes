# coursera-learning-app-wireframes
All designs are intentionally grey‑box and minimal so the focus stays on layout and interaction rather than visual decoration. These can be extended later with additional screens like course details, “My Learning,” or interactive prototype links, but in their current state they already demonstrate a clear, end‑to‑end flow for an education app.
